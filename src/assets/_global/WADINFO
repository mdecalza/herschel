Description             : One short, somewhat difficult MBF21 map using custom
                          enemies, weapons, textures, sounds, and music, all
                          trying to resemble the look and feel of vanilla Doom.
                          Expect difficult ambushes combined with powered up
                          weapons. The fist and chainsaw do extra damage, and
                          almost all the guns have been modified in some way.
                          New enemies join the fight in addition to the usual
                          Doom II suspects.

                          You land in Herschel Crater on Mimas, one of Saturn's
                          moons. The UAC had all underground passages heavily
                          guarded, but it looks like that backfired on them. The
                          demons used the UAC's technology to mutate and conquer
                          the moon base. It's swarming with demons, and it's the
                          only passage to the Miman underworld... Stop them
                          before they take over the whole solar system!
